<h2 #introduction i18n="@@intro">Introduction</h2>

<p i18n="@@p1">
    Hermes system provides a telecommunication system trough the use of short wave HF radio.
</p>

<p i18n="@@p2">
    Hermes system allows transmission of text and files between connected stations, through public messages, sent through this interface or private messages, though Deltachat application or webmail interface.
</p>

<h2 #webint i18n="@@webinterface">Web Interface</h2>

<p i18n="@@p3">
    When accessing the Hermes wifi radio through a cellphone or computer, you will be directed to the Hermes web interface. With that you can send public messages between stations and read messages sent to you community. It's also possible to create users for email accounts and also to administrate the system.
</p>

<h3 #publicm i18n="@@public messages">Public Messages</h3>
<p i18n="@@p4">
    Public messages can be sent between stations, and are listed on the main page of the web interface.
</p>
<p i18n="@@p5">
    By clicking on the <span class="icon"><img src="assets/svg/edit.svg"></span> icon, it's possible to write a new message and to attach files such as images or sound files. 
</p>
<p i18n="@@p6">
    Public messages can be sent to your own station, which is a easy way to publicize news inside your own community.
</p>
<p i18n="@@p7">
    Public messages can also be password protected, which means that only the ones that know the password will be able to read their content, but their description still will be readable by everyone.
</p>
<p i18n="@@p9">
    Have in mind that once a password for the message (has to be at least 4 characcters) is defined, there is no way to recover it, nor to change it.
</p>
<p i18n="@@p10">
    A system administrator can change who can attach files on messages between stations: everyone withe access to the network, only registered users, or only administrators.
</p>

<h3 #transm i18n="@@public messages">Transmission List</h3>

<p i18n="@@p11">
    Once the messages are sent, they will go to a transmission queue before arriving at their final destination. A system administrator can cancel the packages before they are sent, and also delete the sent and received messages. This is a task that need to be done often to avoid that the space in the server ends.
</p>

<p i18n="@@p12">
    As the communication between the stations are unidirectional, the transmissions are schedules to happen every (()))hour, alternating between reception and transmission events. In an emergency case, the system administrator can force message transmission queue by clicking on the "transmit now" link. This can interrupt receiving messages from other stations for a while.
</p>

<h3 #sysa i18n="@@sysadmh">System Administration</h3>

<p i18n="@@p13">
    To access admin features, you need an admin password, while anyone can create an user account, and only the system's admins can create new administrator users.
</p>

<p i18n="@@p10">
    Inside the admin section, an admin user will find the following options:
</p>

<p i18n="@@p10">
    Users management: allows creation of new users, updating data of registered users and to delete users of the system. Every username correspond to a email account with the same name of the kind username@servername. On this station the server name will be <span class="alert">{{system.domain}}</span></p>

<p i18n="@@p10">
    Administrators can also give admin powers to regular users, by clicking on the "is admin" checkbox on the update user interface</p>

<p i18n="@@p10">
    Network info: displays some information about the system, such as network adresses, calsign, servername etc

<p i18n="@@p10">
    Stations: provides a list of the connected stations on the system
</p>

<p i18n="@@p10">
    Detailed Log: provides access to system logs, such as email logs and uucp logs, that register every activity on the system
</p>
<p i18n="@@p10">
    Radio configuration: provides an interface to access and change frequency and radio transmission mode. It also allows to restore factory configuration.
